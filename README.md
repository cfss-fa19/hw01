## Name: Mengdi Huang
* *University of Chicago*
* **MAPSS**
* My research interests:
1. Social Cognition
1. Emotions
1. Behavioral Science

* I got interested in psychology when I was in high school, when I was a volunteer teaching assistant in an autism school. I interacted with a little patient called Dongdong. Though he was very reluctant to interact with me at first, I became his favorite teacher in the end. This experience made me wonder that why patients with autism are often emotionally unstable and what I can do for them. Therefore I decided to study psychology during my undergraduate life.

* Aside from psychology, here is a little fun facts about me:
Born and raised in a small tropical island in China, I chose to study abroad when I was 18 and I completed my undergraduate in California, San Diego, where it has ocean, palm trees and amazing tacos. So this is my first time experiencing actual winter that snows and I hope that I will survive...I also love traveling around, walking in the afternoon and listening to chill lofi music on youtube. My favorite drink is boba :)




*My favorite animal is cat (Though I am a dog person)
