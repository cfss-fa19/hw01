#### Biography (HW1) 

Hi, 

My name is **Victor Vazquez**. I am a second year MPP student from ~~Haris Schul~~, sorry, from Harris School of Public Policy. I have work experience in the private sector, especially in the banking sector. I am a current member of the organizations *Latin American Matters (LAM)* and *Mexicans at Uchicago (UCMA)* at the University of Chicago. Some of the events we like to organize are:

- Discussions with speakers from around the world
- Wine Tasting
    - Includes some games to meet each other
- Trips to latinamerican countries
