### The Beginning
Zach Weinroth was born May 8, 1998 in Summit County, New Jersey.  His parents feared the effects of their child growing up in Jersey and sought out career options in other places. They were able to find work in Denver, Colorado, but they had to weigh the options against each other to be sure it was the right place for the Weinroth family.

New Jersey | Colorado
---------- | --------
Close to New York City | The center of the country
Close to the Atlantic Ocean | Land land to be submerged by rising sea levels
 | Nature is everywhere
 | Land is cheap and spacious, room for kids to play
It's *New Jersey* | It's **Colorado**

The list made it clear that Denver was the best place for the family and that New Jersey didn't have enough positives to stay:
