## General workflow
I used RStudio Cloud on iPad since my laptop is under repair. Basically, after forking the project, I opened a new project with a Git Repo on RStudio Cloud, thus connecting my RStudio to Github. I made changes to the Readme.md using RMarkdown. With some previous experience using Jupyter Notebook with Python, I didn't find any difficulty when using RMarkdown. And now I'm ready to make the push request and upload it back to Github.

## Difficulties
I experienced the most difficulties during the commit and push procedure, expecially wondering how to push the md file along with an image in the working directory.

Initial mistake: I set up the path of the image as /cloud/project/image, according to the directory in Rstudio, however, I should directly set the path according to Github directory.
