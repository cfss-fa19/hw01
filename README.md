### Hi everyone,
My name is Dan Medvedev and I'm from Moscow, Russia. ![](download.jpeg).

I'm a second-year PhD student in **Behavioral Science**. One of the things I do research on is how people's moral evaluations differ based on their environments and cultural backgrounds. 
Before starting my PhD at UChicago I lived in 
* New York City, NY 
* Ithaca, NY
* Boston, MA
* London, England
* Paris, France
* Berlin, Germany
