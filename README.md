## About Me

### Blurb about Home
I am originally from Miami, FL but, currently, my family lives in ~~south~~ southwest Florida. People who are from Miami proper insist that you refer to my part as **SOUTHWEST** Florida, rather than as *South* Florida because they somehow have sole ownership of the direction "south".

### Languages
I spreak three languages with varying levels of fluency:
1. English (Native)
2. Español/Spanish (Native)
3. Русский/Russian (Advanced)

I studied Russian throughout undergrad and found it to be very fulfilling, in no small part thanks to its very rich literarure and folklore! Below are some of the more interesting Russian folksongs I have encountered!

- [The Cossack Lullaby](https://youtu.be/cJsTB-yB-uk)
- [When We Were in the War](https://youtu.be/BFjlYyYEGx0)
- [Trash](https://youtu.be/kOeAXKUK6aM) This one actually isn't a folk song but it is to funny to not include.
