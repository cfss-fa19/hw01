# Sam Sustacek's Biography
My name is Sam Sustacek, as you can tell by the title, and I am a **4th year** at the Univeristy of Chicago. Originally, I'm from Minneapolis, MN, but I haven't lived there in *3 years*, because I spend all of my time in Chicago. 

## Activities and Interests
I've participated in quite a few things since I've been at the University of Chicago. These include:
1. Basketball
  1a. Varsity in High School and College
2. Painting
3. Writing Club
4. Cooking
  4a. Lots of tacos and curry

I had to stop playing basketball after 2 years in college beacuse I had **2 surgeries in 6 months**, but I swear I really did play. If you don't believe me, I brought proof!

Now that my basketball days are behind me, I'm exploring starting a cooking blog, and I'm focusing on improving skills I'm interested in like **programming**!
