## About Me
HELLO! My name is **Jarret Angbazo** and I am a second-year MPP student at the *Harris School of Public Policy*. I was born in Nigeria and before moving to Chicago for graduate school, I grew up in Maryland. Chicago is the furthest west on the continental United States that I've lived.

Quick two truths and a lie:

1. I did this assignment in 5 minutes

2. I don't hate the player, I hate the game

3. I ran a personal best in the 5k this weekend


Here is a [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarretangbazo) to my LinkedIn page. There you will be able to find my employment and education histories.

Thanks for stopping by.
