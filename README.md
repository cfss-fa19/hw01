# Introduction

My name is Taylor Griffin and I am a second year student at the Harris School of Public Policy. Prior to Harris,I served as a Teach for America Corp member.As a Teach for America Corps member, I was challenged to think critically about **policies and practices** that **disproportionately harmed** already vulnerable communities. I realized that access and opportunity do not look the same in every community. If we compare educational inequity to a foot race, all students would participate in the competition, but would not line up at the same starting point. Thus, the fight towards achieving educational equity drives my goal: *to increase access to excellent and equitable education for students of color in low-income communities*. While attending the Harris School of Public Policy, I've become a critical consumer and careful producer of descriptive statistics. The Harris School curriculum has strengthened my quantitative skills and pushed me to provide *data-driven answers to complex questions*.
