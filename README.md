## School-Related Endeavors 

### I am a **third year** at the University of Chicago double-majoring in **Public Policy** and **Linguistics**. This quarter in particular, I'm taking two *Chicago Studies* courses:

* Chicago Linguistics Landscape
* Urban Design with Nature

### They are both fairly research-intensive, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this class will be able to connect with those courses. In general, I've always wanted to do research, so I'm really excited to start finally learning to code!

### I've been surrounded by compsci jokes for at least the past ten years because my dad and brother are both compsci guys, and so another bonus of taking this class is that I will *maybe* be able to understand what they're talking about at family dinners.

## Outside of Class

### I also work as the Financial Manager of Ex Libris Caf√© in the Reg. Essentially what that means is that I have a ton of data at my fingertips, but haven't really learned how to work with it in a meaningful way - another thing that makes this class exciting for me.

### In my free time, I'm a Marketing Director for the Chicago Economics Forum. I recently updated our [website](https://www.cef.edu), and I'm pretty excited about it. I also do a bit of freelance photography, graphic design, and generally try to stay involved in the arts where I can. I have 1662 photos on my camera roll and can guarantee you that more half of them are memes.
