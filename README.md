# Student Introduction: Elliot Karl
### MACS 30500 HW Assignment #1
### October 5, 2019

**About Me:** My name is Elliot Karl and I am a rising second year Masters of Public Policy Student (MPP) at the Harris School of Public Policy. I enrolled in *MACS 30500: Computing for Social Sciences* because I am hoping to:

1. Build on the introductory knowledge I gained in using R at Harris
2. Gain confidence in programming in R so that I can
i) transform large budget data sets for future work in the local public sector which had become tedious (or impossible) in excel,
ii) perform quick statistical summaries of datasets
iii) perform this work in a way that would be reproducable and save me time in the long run.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for years as a budget analyst at the City of Oakland in California. Here is a photo of me working on the [FY20-25 Capital Improvement Program](https://www.oaklandca.gov/documents/fy-2019-21-capital-improvement-program-cip):
