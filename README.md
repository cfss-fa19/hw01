## ABOUT ME

###Introduction

My name is Kriti Bhardwaj, a second year student at Harris School of Public Policy. I am pursuing the MS in Environmental Science and Policy. I have 5 years of work experience as an environmental consultant in India.

###Hobbies

In my free time I love to read fiction/mythological fiction, explore architecture and write poetry.

My top three favorite books are:

* **The Fountainhead** by *Ayn Rand*
* **Kane and Abel** by *Jeffrey Archer*
* **The Alchemist** by *Paulo Coehlo*

###Extra

As my 30th birthday gift, my friend made a website for me https://kritibhardwaj.com, which I haven't gotten around to editing, so please don't judge!
