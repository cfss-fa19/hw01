## Background

Jake is a second year doctoral student in the **Developmental Psychology** program working with Dr. Susan Levine.  He graduated from Williams College in 2014 with honors and a B.A. in Psychology. Jake then spent several years working in education in Singapore before returning to psychological research. Prior to starting graduate school, Jake served as a research assistant and lab manager in the Cognitive Development Lab at the University of Chicago.  

## Research

Jake’s research explores conceptual development with a focus on mathematical symbols and notations. Specifically, he is interested in how ***linguistic input*** and ***spatial representations*** impact children’s understanding of mathematical concepts. 

Through his research, Jake hopes to:

  -Better understand the basic cognitive processes that drive learning  

  -Identify mechanisms to close achievement gaps in mathematics
  
Currently, Jake's projects are exploring the role of hand gestures in early number learning and the use of spatial models (e.g. number lines, pie charts, etc.) in shaping children's fraction knowledge. 

## Personal Interests

In my spare time, I volunteer as a math tutor with elementary and high school students. I enjoy cooking, sports, and strong cups of coffee. I currently serve as treasurer for the Psychology Student Association. I am leading my first discussion section as a TA in Social Psychology.
