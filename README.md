# Introduction of Yi Huang

My name is Yi Huang, a recent graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring in *psychology and economics*. **I had no experience in using R or Rmarkdown, but this homework is not as hard as I thought. The steps and instructions on the website are clear and straightforward.** My github homepage is https://github.com/yihuang97.
