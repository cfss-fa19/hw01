## Rusty Roberts

My name is Rusty! I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the *best* city in the world! You might agree, you might not, but you can't argue with the *emphasis* I've placed on the word *best* to make my claim more compelling. After attending college at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, I worked as a teachcer in New York City for eight years. I'm now a doctoral student at Booth studying behavioral science.
