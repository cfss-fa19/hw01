## My process 
As a Harris student, we are required to learn R coding intensively in the statistics class and program evaluation class. I also apply the knowledge of R in my summer internship back in China for data analysis. So I generally have an idea of how to do all different sources of formatting. However, Gitbub is totally new to me; I do feel a bit loss about what is the purpose of it and how to manuever the process. Therefore, I do find the lab section last week very helpful in terms of fork the repository, pull from Github,commit changes,push to Github, and finally send a pull request.
