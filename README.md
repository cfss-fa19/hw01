<The dash lines creates a slightly smaller header. Pound signs also create a header, with the more pound-signs the smaller heading.>

**My initial thoughts/proccesses/dealings with Github and RStudio:**  

<Stars around a text creates bolded text> 
My first task was to fork the repository to my own GitHub. My biggest fear was accidentally editing the master README.md rather than my own copy of the README.md (thus submitting the entire class to my homework draft). Fortunately, the Fork tool clones a copy of the repository to my own desktop. At first, I was a little confused as to whether the repository was my own, but it was clearly listed under my account.  
From there, I clicked the Clone or download_ button, which provided me with a link to the document located in GitHub. It was from here where my problems started. I was first a little confused, and thought that I needed to create my own Markdown document, and upload it to GitHub. Although I was able to generate new Markdown files in RStudio, I could not figure out how to add it to the Repository (In retrospect, I just needed to upload the documents to GitHub, but this was incorrect for the sake of the homework assignment). I went and reviewed the instructions from the first class. I went to:New Project -> Version Control -> Git -> Repository URL From there, I pasted the URL that I had previously copied, and opened it in a new tab.
