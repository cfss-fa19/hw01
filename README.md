## Reflections on the process
* Problems solved:
  * The picture I wanted to insert here was too large, but I didn't know how to set size for local images at the beginning. The tutorial that helped me solve the problem is the answer of *InspectorSands* on [this stackoverflow website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15625990/how-to-set-size-for-local-image-using-knitr-for-markdown).
  * When trying to commit, I received an error message as follows:
  ```
  *** Please tell me who you are.

  Run

    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

  to set your account's default identity.
  Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
  ```
  [This stackoverflow website](https://superuser.com/questions/1166219/how-do-i-set-my-local-git-identity) helped me to make these settings in the Terminal.
* General impression: Markdown is a powerful tool to format data science work. The [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provided by Github and the cheatsheets handed to us in the first class are both wonderful resources that provide brief introduction to Markdown.
