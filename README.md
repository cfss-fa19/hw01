## Reflections on the process
* Problems solved: The picture I wanted to insert here was too large, but I didn't know how to set size for local images at the beginning. The tutorial that helped me solve the problem is the answer of *InspectorSands* on [this stackoverflow website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15625990/how-to-set-size-for-local-image-using-knitr-for-markdown).
* General impression: Markdown is a powerful tool to format data science work. The [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provided by Github and the cheatsheets handed to us in the first class are both wonderful resources that provide brief introduction to Markdown.
