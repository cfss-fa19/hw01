### By Jacob Sims Speyer

#### October 4, 2019



My name is Jacob Sims Speyer, and I am a third-year Public Policy Major from [Newton, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton,_Massachusetts). I plan on concentrating in health policy, but this may changed. I was inspired to pursue this path after taking a health economics class with Professor David Meltzer last quarter. On campus, I am involved in Model UN and Hillel. In Model UN, I am an Under-Secretary-General for MUNUC (our high school conference), where I oversee the work of multiple committees. I feel _quite strongly_ that Model UN fosters **cooperation and teamwork in an academic setting**. I am also on the administrative board of UChicago Hillel, where I voice feedback on programmatic changes at the organization. A few other things you may not know about me:  

-   I have a twin brother named Josh, who currently attends Middlebury College. Josh is currently studying abroad in China, but he plans to go into medicine. Here is a photo of the two of us:

-   Both my mother and my late father (along with the rest of my family) are South African. However, my family can be traced back to a small town in Germany during the Crusades, and pre-inquisition Portugal  

-   I look up to my late father as a source of inspiration. Before he passed away last year, he reminded me that:

>"You should never give up, even when you get tired of not giving up"
