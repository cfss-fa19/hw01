## About me

My name is *_Audrey Teo_*. I'm a fourth-year student majoring in Public Policy Studies. I'm taking this class because I'm currently working on my B.A. Thesis and think this class would be very helpful when I start working with data. 

### Few examples of data visualization that I've encountered in the past that I think are cool:
1. W.E.E.B. Du Bois's [Infographics of African American Life in the 1900s](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/w-e-b-du-bois-hand-drawn-infographics-of-african-american-life-1900/) 
This one in particular is a very unusual way of data visualization [Image of infographic](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/626/32610925162_cdab5c9cfa_o.jpg)
2. A more recent example of data visualization in ![reporting by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html)
